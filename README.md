# UseSearchParams React hook

## Raison d'Ãªtre:

The creation of this React hook stems from the necessity to effortlessly manage and process URL search parameters within a TypeScript-driven React application. Navigating and extracting information from URL query strings is a common requirement in web development, especially when dealing with dynamic content or user-specific views. This hook simplifies the handling of URL parameters, offering a clean and type-safe solution for developers. It provides a mechanism for maintaining a seamless connection between the application's state and the URL's query parameters.
